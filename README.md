# Video Game Sales Analysis: Exclusivity vs Multi-Platform 

## Overview
This project examines the impact of game exclusivity versus multi-platform releases on video game sales between 1980 and 2016. The study assesses whether multi-platfom games perform better than exclusive titles and how genre and location affect performance by examining global and regional sales data. The information aids game publishers in choosing their target markets and platform strategies.

## Motivation
The release of Helldivers 2 on the Xbox and Sony's job posting for expanding PlayStation titles across multiple platforms served as the impetus for this project. Using data, I aimed to investigate whether game availability across platforms results in increased sales.

## FOlder Structure
- `data/`: Raw and Cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries needed to run the notebooks.
- `Video_Game_Sales_Analysis_Report.ipynb`: Final report with Methodology, Analysis, Key Insights, and Conclusion.

## Key Insights
- Compared to exclusive games, multi-platform games typically have higher global average and total sales.
- Regional variations are important. Because of platform loyalty, exclusive games perform better in Japan.
- Action, sports, and shooter games are the most popular genres worldwide, but role-playing games are especially well-like in Japan.
- Exclusives can increase brand loyalty in niche markets, while multi-platform releases optimize reach in broad markets.

## Tools & Libraries
